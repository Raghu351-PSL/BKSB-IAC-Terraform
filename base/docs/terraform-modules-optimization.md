# Terraform Modules Optimization 
## Overview 
The Terraform configurations have been modularized to improve code quality, maintainability, and adherence to Terraform's best practices. 
## Modules 
### Network 
This module manages the creation of fundamental networking resources: 
- VPC 
- Public and Private Subnets 
- Resource Outputs for Inter-Module Communication 
File Structure: 
- `main.tf`: Defines resources for VPC and subnets. 
- `variables.tf`: Parameters for configuration. 
- `outputs.tf`: Share resources with other modules. 
### Main Configuration 
The root Terraform configuration now relies on modules instead of direct resource definitions. This approach reduces dependency chains and ensures modularity. 
## Testing 
Network configurations can be tested using Terratest. 
Command: 
```bash 
go test ./base/test/network_test.go 
``` 
## Future Recommendations 
- Split large modules based on functionality as the project scales. 
- Regularly validate and lint Terraform configurations with `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate`.
